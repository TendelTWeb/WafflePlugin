### How To
Start by adding a div with the class of .waffle as a holder for the navigation. Then add a div in the .waffle element with the class of .waffle_iron and attribute called data-slide-num equal to 1. Add as many waffle irons as you want with the data-slide-num escalating by 1 each time you make a another waffle iron but note that the waffle is not width-resposive. 
Next, to create the buttons/text inside waffle irons, add a div element with class .waffle_item inside a waffle iron. If you want text inside a waffle item do a plain <a> element. If you want a button/link us a href attribute on the <a> element. You can as many waffle items inside waffle irons as you want but, once again, the waffle is not width-responsive. 
To add slide buttons, start by adding a button inside the waffle, but not waffle iron or item. Add an onclick attribute equal to a function changeNCheck(). For the first parameter in changeNCheck add the number you want to change the slide number by (negative numbers allowed too.) And then, for the second parameter, add the largest number of all data-slide-num attributes.
