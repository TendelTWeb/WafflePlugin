Add as many waffle irons as you want with the data-slide-num escalating by > 1 each time you make a another waffle iron but note that the waffle is not width-resposive. 
> Next, to create the buttons/text inside waffle irons, add a div element with class .waffle_item inside a waffle iron. If you want text > inside a waffle item do a plain ```<a>``` element. If you want a button/link us a href attribute on the ```<a>``` element. You can as  > many waffle items inside waffle irons as you want but, once again, the waffle is not width-responsive.
